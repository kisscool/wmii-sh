Wmii-SH
=======

This is a [`Wmii`](http://wmii.suckless.org/) configuration file customized to add widgets with user event handling while still being as Bourne Shell and POSIX friendly as possible.

You can easily bypass my personnal configuration variables by writing yours in wmiirc_local

Bug tracking
------------

I am using [`Ditz`](http://ditz.rubyforge.org/) in order to track bugs and todo lists in the project.
