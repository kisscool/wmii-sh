Wmii-SH
=======

This is a [`Wmii`](http://wmii.suckless.org/) configuration file customized to add widgets with user event handling while still being as Bourne Shell and POSIX friendly as possible.

You can easily bypass my personnal configuration variables by writing yours in wmiirc_local

How to use Wmii-SH
------------------

### Installation

First of all, clone this repository on your box :

	$ git clone http://github.com/kisscool/wmii-sh.git ~/.wmii

Then copy the wmiirc_local.example file and customize it to follow your needs and overwrite my personnal (bad) tastes

	$ cd ~/.wmii
	$ cp wmiirc_local.example wmiirc_local
	$ vim wmiirc_local

Launch Wmii and enjoy

### Upgrade

Juste upgrade the repository like you would do with a normal git project. The .gitignore file has been configured to avoid conflicts with your local configuration and with files auto-generated by Wmii :

	$ git pull

### Configuring Widgets

In order to add a widget in your Wmii status bar, you need to enter the following in wmiirc_local :

	add_widget $name $refresh_rate $position

with the following arguments :
* $name is the name of the widget (it is also the name of the function which defines it in wmiirc)
* $refresh_rate is the number of seconds between each refresh of the widget visual informations. 0 means no refresh.
* $position defines where the widget will be placed. The widget with the higher number will be at the absolute right of the screen.

For example, in order to add the "load" widget with a refresh rate of 30 seconds :

	add_widget load 30 10

Bug tracking
------------

I am using [`Ditz`](http://ditz.rubyforge.org/) in order to track bugs and todo lists in the project.
